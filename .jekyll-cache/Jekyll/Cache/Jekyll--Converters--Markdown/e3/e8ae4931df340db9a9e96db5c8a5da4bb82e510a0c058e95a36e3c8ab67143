<p>My name is Dave. I was born in Pontiac, MI and grew up in Clarkston, MI (see map below). I then spent a decade in Ann Arbor, MI, where I  received a B.S. in Geology with a Physics minor from the <a href="http://www.umich.edu/">University of Michigan</a>. I decided to stick around Ann Arbor and received my Ph.D. in Geology from the <a href="http://www.lsa.umich.edu/earth/">Department of Geological Sciences</a> (now Earth and Environmental Sciences) in 2008. Four days after turning in my final dissertation revisions, I began a postdoctoral research project in the <a href="http://www.geosciences.univ-rennes1.fr/">Géosciences laboratory</a> at the <a href="https://www.univ-rennes1.fr/">Université de Rennes 1</a>, France. After nine excellent months in Rennes, I returned to North America to continue the postdoctoral project in the Department of Oceanography at <a href="http://www.dal.ca/">Dalhousie University</a> in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. Since 2013 I have been an Professor of Geodynamic Modelling in the <a href="http://www.helsinki.fi/geo/english/index.html">Department of Geosciences and Geography</a> at the <a href="http://www.helsinki.fi/university/">University of Helsinki</a>, Finland.</p>

<p>When I’m not working, I like to hang out with my wife Alyce and our two goofy kids. If there’s any spare time, I enjoy playing ultimate, drinking <a href="http://dieuduciel.com/en/">good beer</a>, biking and music.</p>
