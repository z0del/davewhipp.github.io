<p>I’ve had this site up for several years now, and I’ve never really taken to making regular updates.
I’m also working to reduce the number of online things I need to maintain, and that means I’ll be taking this website down in the next few weeks.
I’ll still keep <a href="https://davewhipp.github.io/markdown-cv/">my Markdown CV</a> online, and have a <a href="https://www.helsinki.fi/en/researchgroups/geodynamics">new research group website</a> that will more than suffice for my needs.</p>

<p>In case you want to get in touch, perhaps email (see <a href="https://www.helsinki.fi/en/researchgroups/geodynamics">research group site</a>) or Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/dave_whipp">@dave_whipp</a>) is easiest.</p>
